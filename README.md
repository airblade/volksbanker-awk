# Volksbanker (AWK)

Prepares Volksbank's electronic statements for upload to Freeagent.

Compared with the [Ruby version](https://github.com/airblade/volksbanker) this is much lighter and more efficient.


## Usage

    vba STATEMENT > out.csv

where STATEMENT is your electronic statement from Volksbank, and `out.csv` is the file you'll upload to Freeagent.


## Installation

Put `vba` on your path and make it executable.


## Testing

    cd test && ./test.sh
